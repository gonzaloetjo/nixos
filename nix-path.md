```
I have one question regarding that. When I tried it as described in that section, nix complained about config being undefined, so I had to change it to a function:
modules = [
    ({config, ...}: {
      xdg.configFile."nix/inputs/nixpkgs".source = nixpkgs.outPath;
      home.sessionVariables.NIX_PATH = "nixpkgs=${config.xdg.configHome}/nix/inputs/nixpkgs$\{NIX_PATH:+:$NIX_PATH}";
      nix.registry.nixpkgs.flake = nixpkgs;
    })
    ./home.nix
];
```

- Do it in an other module file

```
I tried that, with {config, nixpkgs, ...}: { ... } as function definition for the module, but how do I pass nixpkgs into the module? My flake outputs look like this atm (channels.nix being the new module for pinning the channels):
outputs = { nixpkgs, home-manager, ... }:
let
  system = "x86_64-linux";
  pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
in {
homeConfigurations.lanice = home-manager.lib.homeManagerConfiguration {
  inherit pkgs;
  modules = [
    ./channels.nix
    ./home.nix
  ];
};
};
```

```
Use one of the 4 well known ways to pass the inputs into the modules
Function over inputs returning a module, specialArgs, _module.args, overlay

Oookay, took me a bit to figure it out. For anyone else stumbling over this, I changed the channels.nix signature to {nixpkgs}: {config, ...}: { ... } , and called that function (that returns a module) in the let ... in of the flake outputs to have it available as module below. Thanks for the pointer!

Yeah, this is probably all pretty basic stuff... I'm just learning it all piece by piece as I go.  Just yesterday took some time to read a bit into the nix language... Clearly not deep enough ðŸ˜…
